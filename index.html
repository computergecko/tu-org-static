          Around the world, believers are discovering again that everything begins with loving the Lord
          with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. As they draw near to Him and simply do what He
          says, disciples, leaders, and Christ communities begin to multiply in many places — often quietly,
          often in hidden ways. This site only describes what many have seen in Scripture and on the ground,
          and offers simple pathways for you to walk with Him in the same direction.

            In many nations, followers of Jesus are noticing the same pattern: when God’s people return
            to loving Him first, obeying His commands, and helping others do the same, the result is a
            quiet but powerful wave of disciples, leaders, and small Christ communities. It is not built
            around buildings, events, or personalities — but around His presence and His Word.

            These three frameworks are not slogans or programs. They are simple ways of seeing how God often

            To “know” Him in Scripture is a deep, relational knowing — covenant love, trust, and shared life.
